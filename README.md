You'll need to have java on your computer (or maybe the JDK, im not 100% sure) and i use mac but should be same on windows open up terminal (mac) or CMD (windows) type
  `java -jar file.jar`
 but in place of file.jar just drag and drop the file i sent  Will be a better way to run this soon this is just how it works atm
 
JDK 8u171 confirmed working
